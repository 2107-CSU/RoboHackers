Establishing Norms




Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions


* What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
   * Do research as a team and then decide from there
   * Have a vote if needed. 


* What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
   * Pair Program with that person to help identify the frustration. 
   * Understand that the person is not frustrated with others but the program. 
   * “I think”, “I feel”, etc. Not “You are messing up”, etc. 


* What does this group do when we merge our work together?
   * Dev: 
      * Pull/Merge is the developers job AFTER a code review has been completed. 
   * Production: 
      * Merged as a group
      * Thurs end of class. 


* When does this group ask for help?
   * After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
   * Once we’ve completely researched/googled/stackoverflowed the problem. 


* How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
   * Pair choice of when, how, norms, etc. “Roll with the flow” 


* How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours)?
   * Ok to work on *your* assignments on your own time
   * Pull requests MUST go through PRs, you may not Merge a Pull Request on your own. 
   * Solo work is fine but don’t get crazy. 


* What time does this group have daily stand up?
   * Class Days - Start of “Work Time” (15 min)
   * Solo Work - When you’re done maybe do a “Today I worked on Blah Blah” because you probably need a PR
* Push/Pull Request Early and Often
   * Don’t let a bunch of pull requests pile up. 
      * Should be handled if we do small tasks well.
